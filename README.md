# Landing Pages Reproduction

## Description
This project is a collection of faithful reproductions of landing pages from various popular websites. Each page has been painstakingly recreated to perfectly mimic the user interfaces of authentic websites, including login fields for email, phone number, and passwords, as well as associated functionality such as displaying or hiding passwords.

**Main objective**: These reproductions have been developed in a professional context to test user vigilance during phishing simulations, with the aim of improving security within companies.


## Warning
**Important:** This project has been designed exclusively for security audits and phishing simulations in a professional and educational context. Its aim is to make users aware of the dangers of fake login pages and to improve their ability to detect these attempted attacks. Any use for illegal or malicious purposes is strictly prohibited. I accept no responsibility for the use of this project for purposes other than those mentioned.


By working with these pages, you undertake to comply with the laws and regulations in force relating to cybersecurity and data protection.
